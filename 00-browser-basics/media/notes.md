# HTML Media Elements — Images, Audio & Video

## Purpose
Media elements allow content to be:
- Visual
- Auditory
- Multimodal

They also introduce **serious accessibility responsibilities**.

---

## Images (`<img>`)

### The `alt` Attribute ♿
The `alt` text:
- Describes the image for screen readers
- Appears if the image fails to load

Good alt text:
- Describes meaning, not filename
- Is concise but informative

Bad:alt="image1.jpg"


Good:
alt="A person working on a laptop at a desk"



# Audio & Video

-<audio> → sound content

-<video> → visual + audio content

-controls → provides user control

### Accessibility for Media ♿

* Videos should have captions

* Audio content should have transcripts

* Users must control playback

* Avoid autoplay

### Common Mistakes

❌ Missing alt attributes
❌ Using images instead of text
❌ Autoplaying media
❌ No captions for videos

### Exercises

Change alt text to something vague — notice the difference

Remove controls and think about usability

Add a decorative image with empty alt
