    FILE: script-order.html

    PURPOSE:
    This file demonstrates how the browser reads HTML
    from top to bottom and how JavaScript depends on
    elements already existing in the DOM.

    KEY IDEA:
    JavaScript can ONLY interact with elements that
    the browser has already parsed.

  <title>Script Order Test</title>

  <!--
    ⚠️ IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT

    This script is intentionally placed BEFORE the <h1> element.
    Open the browser console to observe what happens.

    STEPS:
    1. Open this file in the browser
    2. Open DevTools → Console
    3. Observe the output

    EXPECTED RESULT:
    - The script runs
    - The <h1> element is NOT found (null)

    WHY?
    Because the browser has not reached the <h1> yet
    when this script executes.
  -->

  <script>
    console.log("Script is running...");

    // Try to select the <h1> element
    const heading = document.querySelector("h1");

    // Log the result to the console
    console.log("Heading element:", heading);
  </script>

</head>
<body>

  <!--
    This <h1> element appears AFTER the script above.

    At the moment the script runs, this element
    does NOT exist in the DOM yet.
  -->
  <h1>Frontend Foundation</h1>

  <!--
    🧪 EXPERIMENTS TO TRY (VERY IMPORTANT)

    1️⃣ Move the <script> tag to the bottom of the body
       → Reload the page
       → Observe that the <h1> is now found

    2️⃣ Move the script back to the <head>
       Add the attribute: defer
       Example:
       <script defer>...</script>

       → Reload and observe the difference

    3️⃣ Change the text of the <h1> using JavaScript
       once it is successfully selected
  -->

</body>
</html>
